    BaseSkyMap is an abstract base class. Subclasses must do the following:

    @li define __getstate__ and __setstate__ to allow pickling (the butler saves sky maps using pickle);

    All SkyMap subclasses must be conceptually immutable; they must always
    refer to the same set of mathematical tracts and patches even if the in-
