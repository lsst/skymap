    The tract is subdivided into rectangular patches. Each patch has the following properties:
    - An inner region defined by an inner bounding. The inner regions of the patches exactly tile the tract,
      and all inner regions have the same dimensions. The tract is made larger as required to make this work.
    - An outer region defined by an outer bounding box. The outer region extends beyond the inner region
      by patchBorder pixels in all directions, except there is no border at the edges of the tract.
      Thus patches overlap each other but never extend off the tract. If you do not want any overlap
      between adjacent patches then set patchBorder to 0.
    - An index that consists of a pair of integers:
        0 <= x index < numPatches[0]
        0 <= y index < numPatches[1]
      Patch 0,0 is at the minimum corner of the tract bounding box.
